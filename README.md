# Data-Structures-Project-
This is my project for Data Structures during the spring of 2018
The project was a make your own using three of the various datascrutctures we had learned thorughout the semester. 
I ended up creating a program to determine the best path; taking into account things such as asiles, enterence and casiher stands. This program contains a hash table full of the grocery store items as can been seen from store.txt
For example: Apples is set as 1 1 which indicates it is the first item on the first asile.
